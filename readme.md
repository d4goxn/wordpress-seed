# WordPress Seed

A WordPress install with example config files: Apache virtual host config and a hosts file.

* URL: wordpress-seed.local
* Web root, hardcoded: /home/dan/Projects/wordpress-seed/www

## TODO:

Installer using Grunt and wp-cli. [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/) is pretty cool on its own, but I would like to be able to set up a WP site with a single command + config file + prompts.
